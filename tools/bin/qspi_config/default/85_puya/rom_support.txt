The following devices have ROM support and do not need MIB keys:

Puya P2580L(*)
Puya P2580LE
Puya P25Q16L
Puya P25Q32L(*)
Puya P25Q64L(*)

* - These QSPI parts cannot perform quad reads at 80MHz. On CSRA68105 devices,
    the 80 or 120MHz clock source is divided by 2. QCC512x and QCC514x devices do
    not use the clock divider and therefore the SqifClockControl MIB key must be
    configured such that these QSPI parts use the 32MHz crystal clock source.
